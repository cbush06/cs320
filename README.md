# CS320 - Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

This project accompanies a video series created to help my Southern New Hampshire University CS320 class.

If you want to follow along with the video series (highly encouraged), clone the `starter` branch. The `master` branch is the end result of the video series.

## Video Series

You can find the video series at my YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Qak8r8wDYplRHuvXAm7IDMmoQymDd-8

The video series includes:

- **Video 1:** Cloning this project and importing it into Eclipse
- **Video 2:** Coding and testing the `Contact` entity
- **Video 3:** Coding and testing the `Contact` service
